# The Need to Innovate

## Summary

This post is about innovation - what it is, why it's important, and the cost of not doing it.

## What is innovation

Innovation is all around us. It's the thing that pulls the world forward. What turns sci-fi into reality. Innovation is our progression forward as humans. It's the creation of new, and making the old easier.

Technology is a constant - it's always been around and always will be around

It's piecing together history to create something new for the world

It's seeing opportunity and thinking differently to capture value from that opportunity

## Macro-view on innovation

Innovation is constant, it always happens whether a single company decides to do it or not. Innovation is the difference between surviving or not as a company.

## Impact to Corporations

Large companies over time become increasingly more complex.



## Why we don't innovate

[to do]

- Lack of insight into how the bottom line is impacted
- people not wanting to try because it's extra work
