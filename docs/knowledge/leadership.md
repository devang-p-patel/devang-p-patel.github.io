# Leadership

Thoughts on the art of leadership and how to lead

**Contents**

## Three types of people

Leaders = People that set a vision and lead others

Followers = People who don't have a vision but are ready to follow and make a leaders vision real


## Difference between Leaders and Followers

A leader wakes up every morning to a blank page and writes the novel. Followers are given guardrails and often times a set of instructions of what to do. A leaders role is exhausting, it's to create something that has never existed. Therefore, learning how to lead is critical.


### Tribes and Leadership

"Every tribe is different. Every leader is different. The very nature of leadership is that you're not doig what's been done before. If you were, you'd be following, not leading" - Tribes by Seth Godin
